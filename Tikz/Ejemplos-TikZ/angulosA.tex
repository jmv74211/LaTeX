PGF 3.0 brings a new library for drawing angles. A pic type angle=a--b--c
adds a drawing of an angle to the current path. It consists of a "sector"
or "wedge" or "slice" whose pointed end is at point b and whose straight
sides lie on the lines from b to A and from B to C. You can specify
radius and eccentricity.

Another new library "quotes" is providing a quote syntax for labels, pins,
edge nodes, and pic texts. You can use a simple string "text" or a string with
options, such as node["text" {red, draw, thick}] to achieve an effect like
node[label={[red,draw,thick]text}] with less writing and more readability.

This code was written by Paul Gaborit and published on TeX.SE.

    pic["$\alpha$", draw=orange, <->, angle eccentricity=1.2, angle radius=1cm]
    {angle=a--b--c};
